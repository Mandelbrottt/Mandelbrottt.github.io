**Avanzar** is a rogue-like FPS game that takes place in a randomly generated ancient Mesoamerican temple. Fight through a number of unique enemies and bosses while finding game-changing weapon modifications and character upgrades.

I am the game systems and tools programmer with Jampacked Interactive for this ongoing project being developed in the Unity game engine. We are currently developing this game as a continuation of a school project and are looking to eventually have a commercial release.

### My Contributions

* Source control management automation using git hooks and build information
* Modular weapon attachment, rule-based dungeon room completion, and loot drop systems
* Custom level serialization in anticipation of user-generated level support
* Editor tools and UI that enhance the speed of development
