Washbucklers is a 2v2, nautical themed party game which pits two teams of pirates against each other, battling for naval superiority in an all-out ecological warfare that was developed in tandem with [Oyl3D](/projects/2-oyl3d.html).

I worked as the team's software engineer developing the engine powering the game. For more information on my direct contributions to the game, see [The Oyl3D project page](/projects/2-oyl3d.html).

## My Contributions

* Direct technical support for any issues that arise
* Worked with the team to develop new features that would aid development
