Juliabrot Visualiser was a project developed as part of GDJam 2019, where the theme was "lost and found". This project fits the theme by being a remake of a project I lost the files to a number of years ago, and recently came across again.

I worked as a solo-developer over the 48 hour jam to develop this neat little toy. Using custom unity shaders, the visualiser allows users to zoom into the mandelbrot set, and generate julia sets by clicking on the mandelbrot set in various places. The user can also generate higher-order mandelbrot and julia sets.
