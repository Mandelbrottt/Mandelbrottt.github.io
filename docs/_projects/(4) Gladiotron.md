Gladiotron is a story-driven, 3rd person action-adventure game inspired by games like metroid and megaman being developed by Full Circle CS in Unreal Engine 4.

I worked as a systems programmer on a temporary basis with the development team of five. I worked primarily to support the existing development by developing extensions to existing systems, and converting others from Unreal blueprints to C++ in the name of performance and modularity.

# My Contributions

* C++ build automation to make integrating code changes easier for designers and artists
* Converted core systems from blueprints to C++
* Player upgrade management system
* Dialogue storage and retrieval solution driven by xml
