**Oyl3D** is a custom 3D game engine written in C++ that makes use of OpenGL, Bullet3D Physics, Entt ECS, Skeletal Animation, a GUI editor, and more. Oyl3D was designed with ECS as the main method of interacting with the game world in the interest of performance. 

I was the main developer on the Oyl3D project working in tandem with a team of six to develop our game [Washbucklers](/projects/4-washbucklers.html) as part of a school project. I developed the bulk of the engine on my own, and the rest of my team worked on developing the game.

## Features

* OpenGL Rendering with support for custom shaders and post processing
* Integrated physics engine powered by Bullet3D
* Entity Component System frontend API powered by Entt
* Animation pipeline with morph targets and skeletal animation
* Full GUI Editor with component inspector, scene saving and loading, scene manipulation widgets, scene hierarchy, play/pause button, and more.
